# Augmented Focus
An Augmented Reality (AR) game made with Unity & C#, which challenges how long a player can keep track of a fidgety flying creature such as a hummingbird.  

Before playing, please make sure that you have ample space to move around, and that you are in a safe area with no people or things that could obstruct your movement or injure you.  

The player searches for the hummingbird, 


## About
"Augmented Focus" uses an Android phone's built-in camera and built-in sensors (specifically the gyroscope) for the AR to orient the phone and the game piece.  

This is my second project working with 'markerless' augmented reality and using the phone sensors.  

I took the foundations of what I learned from [Dizzy](https://github.com/BerniceChua), and expanded on the gameplay while refactoring/improving the code.  

I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH: Before playing, please make sure that you have ample space to move around, and that you are in a safe area with no people or things that could obstruct your movement or injure you.

## Issues
### To-Dos & Stretch Goals:
1. Keeping score & tracking time properly (completed).  
2. Choose a font that fits the mood better.  
3. UI & UX improvements - add option to adjust or mute the music & sounds.
4. UI & UX improvements - aethetics/color.
5. Add creature sounds
6. Add difficulty levels (easy = slower speed and less variations in movement, medium = a bit faster speed and slightly more variations in movement, difficult = very fast movement speeds and a wide variation in movement).
7. Add different creatures (other flying creatures? but more likely other species of hummingbirds) to choose from? (OPTIONAL)
