# Dizzy
Augmented Reality 'endless runner' game made with Unity & C#, which uses an Android phone's built-in sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, compass) to control the player character's movements.  Spin around faster to move faster!  Please make sure that you have ample space to move around, and that you are in a safe area with no people or things that could obstruct your movement or injur you.

## About
This was our entry for [AT&T VR/AR Hackathon - Bay Area](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/att-vrar-hackathon-bay-area-tickets-33467242423#).  In this prototype for an AR "game", players move the player character by spinning themselves around while holding their phone.  The faster you spin, the faster your character moves.

## Issues
### To-Dos & Stretch Goals:
1. Add incentives for players to move faster (if player hits the side of the screen it is running away from, it will explode).
2. Add movement options (jumping).
